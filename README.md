# Triple-count-newton-math
Newton likes to play with numbers. He is given two integers N and K. Find the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all multiples of K. The order of a, b, and c does matter, and some of them can be the same. Input The input line contains N and K separated by space.
